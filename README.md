## Hi there :wave:

I'm a professional software engineer and I like contributing to free software and open source in general in my spare time.

I've made small contributions to several projects over the years. I also contribute by open sourcing a few projects of mine:

* :computer: A [Home Assistant IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://github.com/daniele-athome/hass-intellij-plugin)
* :house: My [Home Assistant configuration](https://github.com/daniele-athome/hass-config) which you might or might not find useful
* :framed_picture: An [Immich add-on for syncing birth dates with contacts from a CardDAV server](https://github.com/daniele-athome/immich-carddav-sync) - by the way I contributed the birth date feature on Immich so you can blame me for that :sweat_smile:
* :small_airplane: A very opinionated [Flutter app for small groups of aircraft owners](https://github.com/daniele-athome/airborne)
* :package: An [apt repository with a few packages I build](https://github.com/daniele-athome/my-debian-packages)
* :small_airplane: (Italian only) [Un simulatore di esame per l'attestato di volo VDS per Android](https://github.com/daniele-athome/esamevds-android)
